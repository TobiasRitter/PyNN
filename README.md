# PyNN

This project aims to implement a fully functional Multi-Layer Perceptron in Python. It relies on the [numpy](https://numpy.org/) library. The project should point out the fundamental concepts of Artifical Neural Networks, such as forward and backward propagation. This project was heavily inspired by the *Machine Learning (IN2064)* lecture at Technical University of Munich.

## Structure

+ Implementations of various types of layers can be found within the *layers.py* file.
+ Implementations of error functions can be found within the *error.py* file.
